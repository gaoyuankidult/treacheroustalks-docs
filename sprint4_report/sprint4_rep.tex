\section{The Sprint}
\subsection{Plan ..}
The main focus of this sprint was to load test our system and find out where
our bottlenecks are. This also made it necessary (or very helpful) to further
improve our build system and especially to create a centralised way to start
and connect a whole cluster on several machines: the {\tt cluster\_manager}. \\
We also worked on fault tolerance of our backends: the ultimate goal here is
to handle the breakdown of servers gracefully: requiring users logged in on the
broken server to re-login and restarting games that were running on a different
server. We also scheduled much work on the in-game and off-game messaging system.

\subsection{.. and Reality}
We managed to fulfill the sprint goal and even pulled in more stories from
the back log, handling some features regarding the ``operator''-role:
dynamically adding and removing servers to our backend-cluster. \\
The benchmarks immediately highlighted some small bugs with big influences:
an unreasonable hunger for memory and the unnecessary allocation of ets-tables
that made us hit an internal limit on their numbers quickly. \\ Both of these
bugs where identified and resolved quickly. \\
More worrying (because it is unresolved) though is the fact that our system exhibits throughput
degradation under load; one of sprint 5's goals is to fix that problem. \\
We also evaluated our system in terms of scalability and are quite happy with
these results, although we do not think that what we have is enough.
