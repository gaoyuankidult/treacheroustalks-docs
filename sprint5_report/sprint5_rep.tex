\section{The Sprint}

The plan was to make the game more usable as well as extend the operator's overview in the web interface.
A big part of the sprint was the preparation of the presenation for the second project review which was
due on Dec, 15th. \\
One noteworthy improvement is the addition of a graphical map to the web interface (based on an html5
canvas). Handling loss of servers remained as a task since some problems were discovered. \\
We successfully played our game and discovered some bugs; it is not certain whether we can clear all
of them after christmas.
